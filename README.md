I'm Alex, 24 years old from Hungary, based in somewhere on this earth (changing pretty frequently)
I was always interested about IT, most of my family members are working in the IT section and I also have some really basic knowledge which I'm hoping to extend here.
Recently I traveled in Latin America for 11 months while working as a photo and videographer, I'm not sure if it's an advantage here, but who knows? :D
